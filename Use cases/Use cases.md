Last email from Sales rep: Good morning,  I sent an invitation to the zoom meeting. Wed May 10, 2023 4pm - 4:30pm (CEST). Regards, Bartłomiej

Our plans have changed. We've already received a commercial proposal for a security audit from Company A, and we're getting ready to sign it now. So I want to cancel the meeting by company B. But if something goes wrong, we have to contact company B and get a commercial proposal from them. Write an email to company B that we need to cancel now (don't mention that we've already received another proposal), but we'll probably come back in the future.
